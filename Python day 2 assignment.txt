PROJECT :

Let's say, you are in a lottery competition. A group of words has been given to you and you are asked to select any one character(only alphabets) which will get you a prize. You are a smart person and you thought of a way to select a character that will have maximum chances of winning a prize i.e. select the highest occurring character from the words.


SOLUTION :

# lowercase alphabets - ASCII code: 97 to 122
for i in s:
  freq[ord(i) - 97] += 1

print(freq)
x = freq.index(max(freq))
print(x)
print(chr(97 + x))
s = 'welcome'
d = {}

for i in s:
  d[i] = d.get(i, 0) + 1
  print(d)

print(d)
